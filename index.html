        <h1>FastComments GitHub Pages Demo</h1>
        <p>
            This article is just a demo of FastComments using Github's static Pages. The comment thread at the bottom is a live version of the
            service.</p>
        <p>Leave a comment, or vote on a few comments. Maybe share some cat pictures.</p>
        <p>If you leave a comment and don't verify it via email within three days it'll automatically be removed. This is
            one of FastComment's
            powers to fight spam.</p>
        <p>It may not look impressive, but that's its job. <strong>FastComments should get out of the way of your
            users</strong> and let them engage with you. So the less impact the better.</p>
